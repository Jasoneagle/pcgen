I am trying to Code up the Races of Ansalon book to Use in my games (and will also be using Bahamauts Data sets as a Base.)
I am Currently Stuck on these Issues:

Based on Looking into Some list files To add Sub Race: Place in Ability File?
Or is there Documentation somewhere that Explains how to Create Subraces can Someone point me to it?

Sample Subrace entry?
Tarmak (Krynn)
	KEY:Ithin’carthians ~ Tarmak (Krynn)
	CATEGORY:Internal
	TYPE:Ithin’carthiansSubrace.Krynn_Campaign

Don't Know how to add/Create Regions. Can someone help or Point me to where to find the Directions to do so.

Sample Reagon I want to Create:
Region	Abanasinia
Favored Class: Master or Rouge
Bonus First Level Feat Choice additions:Persuasive,Skill Focus,Toughness
Automatic Class Skills:Profession
Automatic Languages:Abanasinian,Common
Bonus Languages:Camptalk,Dwarven,Elven,Kharolian,Solamnic
Auto Equipment choice if first level is Master or Rouge: Masterwork studded leather armor or masterwork artisan’s tools.




Race to add:Ithin’carthian A subrace of humans But will be adding as a race with 3 Sub races(Stats are Derived by one of 3 Sub races)
Stats Dependent on Subtype. Or Would it Just be more Feasable to add each as a race?
